                            UnityCare serves as a bridge to connect the enterprise and individual who have financial 
                            difficulties or physical disabilities. Through UnityCare, enterprises may improve their 
                            corporate reputation by caring for vulnerable groups and may receive government subsidies 
                            as a support for enterprises caring for vulnerable groups. On the other hand, individuals 
                            with disabilities can find available jobs and attend skill development programs for financial
                             and intellectual stability. Moreover, volunteers can gain knowledge on the way to deal with 
                             people with physical disabilities by participating in volunteering programs. UnityCare plays
                              a role in fostering a culture of empathy and collective responsibility by publicly sharing 
                              relevant poverty information. This is crucial in raising awareness about the poverty issue 
                              in our country or around the world. By providing accessible information, UnityCare educates
                               the public about the socioeconomic issues that lead to poverty such as unemployment or war,
                                the impact of poverty on communities and ongoing efforts to reduce these challenges.
